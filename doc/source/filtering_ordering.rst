Filtering and ordering
======================

For the examples in this section, we will be using the following model::

    class SupplierRel(StructuredRel):
        since = DateTimeProperty(default=datetime.now)


    class Supplier(StructuredNode):
        name = StringProperty()
        delivery_cost = IntegerProperty()


    class Coffee(StructuredNode):
        name = StringProperty(unique_index=True)
        price = IntegerProperty()
        suppliers = RelationshipFrom(Supplier, 'SUPPLIES', model=SupplierRel)

Filtering
=========

neomodel allows filtering on nodes' and relationships' properties. Filters can be combined using Django's Q syntax. It also allows multi-hop relationship traversals to filter on "remote" elements.

Filter methods
--------------

The ``.nodes`` property of a class returns all nodes of that type from the database.

This set (called `NodeSet`) can be iterated over and filtered on, using the `.filter` method::

    # nodes with label Coffee whose price is greater than 2
    high_end_coffees = Coffee.nodes.filter(price__gt=2)

    try:
        java = Coffee.nodes.get(name='Java')
    except DoesNotExist:
        # .filter will not throw an exception if no results are found
        # but .get will
        print("Couldn't find coffee 'Java'")

The filter method borrows the same Django filter format with double underscore prefixed operators:

- lt - less than
- gt - greater than
- lte - less than or equal to
- gte - greater than or equal to
- ne - not equal
- in - item in list
- isnull - `True` IS NULL, `False` IS NOT NULL
- exact - string equals
- iexact - string equals, case insensitive
- contains - contains string value
- icontains - contains string value, case insensitive
- startswith - starts with string value
- istartswith - starts with string value, case insensitive
- endswith - ends with string value
- iendswith - ends with string value, case insensitive
- regex - matches a regex expression
- iregex - matches a regex expression, case insensitive

These operators work with both `.get` and `.filter` methods.

Combining filters
-----------------

The filter method allows you to combine multiple filters::

    cheap_arabicas = Coffee.nodes.filter(price__lt=5, name__icontains='arabica')

These filters are combined using the logical AND operator. To execute more complex logic (for example, queries with OR statements), `Q objects <neomodel.Q>` can be used. This is borrowed from Django.

``Q`` objects can be combined using the ``&`` and ``|`` operators. Statements of arbitrary complexity can be composed by combining ``Q`` objects
with the ``&`` and ``|`` operators and use parenthetical grouping. Also, ``Q``
objects can be negated using the ``~`` operator, allowing for combined lookups
that combine both a normal query and a negated (``NOT``) query::

    Q(name__icontains='arabica') | ~Q(name__endswith='blend')

Chaining ``Q`` objects will join them as an AND clause::

    not_middle_priced_arabicas = Coffee.nodes.filter(
        Q(name__icontains='arabica'),
        Q(price__lt=5) | Q(price__gt=10)
    )

Traversals and filtering
------------------------

Sometimes you need to filter nodes based on other nodes they are connected to. This can be done by including a traversal in the `filter` method. ::

    # Find all suppliers of coffee 'Java' who have been supplying since 2007
    # But whose prices are greater than 5
    since_date = datetime(2007, 1, 1)
    java_old_timers = Coffee.nodes.filter(
            name='Java',
            suppliers__delivery_cost__gt=5,
            **{"suppliers|since__lt": since_date}
        )

In the example above, note the following syntax elements:

- The name of relationships as defined in the `StructuredNode` class is used to traverse relationships. `suppliers` in this example.
- Double underscore `__` is used to target a property of a node. `delivery_cost` in this example.
- A pipe `|` is used to separate the relationship traversal from the property filter. The filter also has to included in a `**kwargs` dictionary, because the pipe character would break the syntax. This is a special syntax to indicate that the filter is on the relationship itself, not on the node at the end of the relationship.
- The filter operators like lt, gt, etc. can be used on the filtered property.

Traversals can be of any length, with each relationships separated by a double underscore `__`, for example::

    # country is here a relationship between Supplier and Country
    Coffee.nodes.filter(suppliers__country__name='Brazil')

Enforcing relationship/path existence
-------------------------------------

The `has` method checks for existence of (one or more) relationships, in this case it returns a set of `Coffee` nodes which have a supplier::

    Coffee.nodes.has(suppliers=True)

This can be negated by setting `suppliers=False`, to find `Coffee` nodes without `suppliers`.

You can also filter on the existence of more complex traversals by using the `traverse_relations` method. See :ref:`Path traversal`.

Ordering
========

neomodel allows ordering by nodes' and relationships' properties. Order can be ascending or descending. Is also allows multi-hop relationship traversals to order on "remote" elements. Finally, you can inject raw Cypher clauses to have full control over ordering when necessary.

order_by
--------

Ordering results by a particular property is done via the `order_by` method::

    # Ascending sort
    for coffee in Coffee.nodes.order_by('price'):
        print(coffee, coffee.price)

    # Descending sort
    for supplier in Supplier.nodes.order_by('-delivery_cost'):
        print(supplier, supplier.delivery_cost)


Removing the ordering from a previously defined query, is done by passing `None` to `order_by`::

    # Sort in descending order
    suppliers = Supplier.nodes.order_by('-delivery_cost')

    # Don't order; yield nodes in the order neo4j returns them
    suppliers = suppliers.order_by(None)

For random ordering simply pass '?' to the order_by method::

    Coffee.nodes.order_by('?')

Traversals and ordering
-----------------------

Sometimes you need to order results based on properties situated on different nodes or relationships. This can be done by including a traversal in the `order_by` method. ::

    # Find the most expensive coffee to deliver
    # Then order by the date the supplier started supplying
    Coffee.nodes.traverse("suppliers").order_by(
        '-suppliers__delivery_cost',
        'suppliers|since',
    )

In the example above, note the following syntax elements:

- The name of relationships as defined in the `StructuredNode` class is used to traverse relationships. `suppliers` in this example.
- Double underscore `__` is used to target a property of a node. `delivery_cost` in this example.
- A pipe `|` is used to separate the relationship traversal from the property filter. This is a special syntax to indicate that the filter is on the relationship itself, not on the node at the end of the relationship.
- The traversal is done explicitly before the ordering, so that the traversed relationship's properties are available for ordering.

Traversals can be of any length, with each relationships separated by a double underscore `__`, for example::

    # country is here a relationship between Supplier and Country
    Coffee.nodes.order_by('suppliers__country__latitude')

RawCypher
---------

When you need more advanced ordering capabilities, for example to apply order to a transformed property, you can use the `RawCypher` method, like so::

    from neomodel.sync_.match import RawCypher

    class SoftwareDependency(AsyncStructuredNode):
        name = StringProperty()
        version = StringProperty()

    SoftwareDependency(name="Package2", version="1.4.0").save()
    SoftwareDependency(name="Package3", version="2.5.5").save()

    latest_dep = SoftwareDependency.nodes.order_by(
        RawCypher("toInteger(split($n.version, '.')[0]) DESC"),
    )

In the example above, note the `$n` placeholder in the `RawCypher` clause. This is a placeholder for the node being ordered (`SoftwareDependency` in this case).
